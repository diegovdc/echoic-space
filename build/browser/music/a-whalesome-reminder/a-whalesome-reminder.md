This track was found one day that I was listening to an exercise I did using a 13-limit scale that Noah Jordan shared with me. At some point during the playback an alarm I've been using often started to sound. It was a field recording of a humpback whale and I was surprised by the harmonic and melodic affinity between the two. My speculation is that by my love of whale-song and my familiarity to this particular recording, I unknowingly reproduced some of it's contours without noticing... Time just took it upon itself to let me know what had I done. 

This particular whale-song recording was done by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and can be found [freesound.org](freesound.org).
