A new EP by Piraran https://piraran.bandcamp.com/track/with-out-dancing
 
 "A revolution without dancing is not a revolution worth having"
- Emma Goldman, attributed quote

"If I can't dance I don't want to be part of your (r)evolution"
- Emma Goldman, alternate attribution, parenthesis is ours

"though it might seem that her insistence in freedom to change would invalidate the idea of promise or vow, in fact the freedom made the promise meaningful. A promise is a direction taken, a self-limitation of choice… if no direction is taken, if one goes nowhere, no change will occur. One's freedom to choose and to change will be unused, exactly as if one were in jail, a jail of one's own building, a maze in which no one way is better than any other. So Odo came to see the promise, the pledge, the idea of fidelity, as essential in the complexity of freedom."
- Ursula K. Le Guin, The Dispossessed

The music here is based on a sample from Beverly Craven's "Promise Me". Here's a voice suspended in time, never fully formed, neither fully present nor completely gone, a ghost of a future to come, wavering, still, but, still awaiting, yes. With it we want to evoke a different kind promise, the "promise and provocation" of an emancipated future (cf. Acid Communism, Fisher), that of a world which contains many other worlds in healthy and mutually beneficial co-existence (cf. Zapatista Philosophy). Despite the usual (western) “common sense” understanding of human societies, these kinds of worlds are and have been a real effective possibility throughout the history of our species (cf. The Dawn of Everything, Graber & Wengrow).

With this music we want to honor this promise of love for the continued existence of all human and non-human life, as a song-call to all that binds us together through, quite literally, these DNA which threads us with all life on earth. We sing and sound here in recognition of all those who are being oppressed and exploited because we know that a world without these is possible.
