This piece is part of an investigation into the resonances of the electric guitar. I have been particularly interested in chaos theory and the idea of attractors, so this is an attempt to explore and produce music following those concepts.

Of interest for this group are I think, the rhythmic ideas. Sounds are produced through percussion on the instrument at different tempos. Some tempos reinforce the beatings of the string resonances, others contradict them.

I do not know the exact pitches to which the guitar was tuned, but you can hear each open string being played at the very beginning. The tuning stays the same for the first 12 minutes, then there are slight modifications to it as well as preparation with resonators on the strings towards the end.

I feel I must note that no effects or overdubs where used in this recording.

Would love to know what you think about this.

Thanks for listening
