A collaboration with Iris Saladino, Munshkr fand Bembi from [CLiC](https://colectivo-de-livecoders.gitlab.io/) who designed a [blackmidi player](https://github.com/blackcodedmidi) for use with live coding. Used Nanc-in-a-Can's [FluentCan](https://github.com/nanc-in-a-can/fluent-can) for the sequencing. They glitched and crashed the UI, but I still like the patterns.
